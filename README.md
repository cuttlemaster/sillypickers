# silly-pickers

My development team does quarterly showcases where we build small projects with the intent of learning something new along the way we can share with the team and improve our own skills and spread around interesting and helpful learnings. For the Q3 2019 showcase I decided to make a random generator engine that runs off of the various "name" or "title" generators you see posted on Facebook or Instagram that have you pick options based on things like your initials, birthday, or some other arbitrary data.

## Intended Functionality
* User receives a random "picker" from the website to complete
* User is prompted to provide information the chosen "picker" requires
* User is given the result of their "picker" and can choose to go again
* Storing which "pickers" have been completed so repeats are not given to the user

## Desired Skills Development
* Focus on re-learning some vanilla javascript basics
* Focus on object oriented javascript functions
* Learn the basics of the Fetch API in vanilla javascript

### Developmet Instructions
* When developing locally, run `npm run scss` to ensure styles are compiled as changes are made.
