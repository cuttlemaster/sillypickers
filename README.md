# frivolous-generators

As part of a development team showcase I wanted to try my hand at making at some more involved javascript work and shake off some rust with using reusable functions to maninpulate the DOM and give users different choices to generate some frivolous and fun results. The basis for the project is the various "name" or "title" generators that you see posted on Facebook or Instagram where you pick options from a list based on your initials, birthday, or some other arbitrary data.

The idea is to have a few of these generators available to choose from, dynamically generate the inputs to collect options, and then use JSON data storage to output the answer to the user on the screen.

### Helpful Instructions

When developing, make sure to run `npm run scss` so that the scss files compile!
